# Calculator
This simple calculator can do multiple mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic operations, some trigonometric operations and some other general operations

## Instructions for users
### For Trigonometric operations
During Trigonometric operation put the angles in radiun form to get the correct output. 

Eg. Instead of sin(30Â°), write sin(pi/6). 
### For general algebric operations
To avoid wrong output, use power operations by parts. 

Eg. Instead of doing (5^2 + 3^3), first calculate 5^2, then add 3^3 with the previous output to get the final desired output.
